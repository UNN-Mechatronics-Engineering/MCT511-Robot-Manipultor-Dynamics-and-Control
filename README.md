# MCT511-Robot-Manipultor-Dynamics-and-Control
Robot manipulators are articulated mechanical systems composed of links connected by joints. The dynamic equations of a robot manipulator can be obtained from Newton's equations of motion or, via Lagrange's equations. Here we considered a robot manipulator of 2 degrees of freedom (2-DOF) using the Lagrangian approach.
